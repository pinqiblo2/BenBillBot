            Think of all the places you can mount your phone now! Taxis? Planes? Busses?? Trains???
        </p>
        <p>
            Now for the riddle:<br />
            <b>What is the difference between our phones' passcodes?</b>
        </p>
        <div id="guess-content">
            <input id="guess" type="number" />
            <button onclick="guess()">Guess</button>
        </div>

        <div id="gift-container" style="display: none;">
            <canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
            <div id="gift" style="display: none;">
                I know you're more interested in public transit than trains themselves, but I thought it would be neat to get your a year membership to the Narrow Gauge Railway Co. here in Portland.
                There's several perks of membership, mainly ticket and souvenir discounts.
