            Hope you like the mug! I thought the heatup pattern was cool. If you don't think you'll drink from it it, you can always use it to pot plants.

            Now for the riddle:<br />
            <b>What Animal Crossing character is my avatar on our switch?</b>

        <div id="guess-content">
            <input id="guess" type="text" />
            <button onclick="guess()">Guess</button>
        </div>

        <div id="gift-container" style="display: none;">
            <canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>
            <div id="gift" style="display: none;">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="js-display"></div>

        <script src="gift.js"></script>
        <script>
            function guess(e) {
                if (document.getElementById('guess').value.toLowerCase() === "punchy")
                    document.getElementById('gift-container').style.display = 'flex';
            }
        </script>
